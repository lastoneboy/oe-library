# Spin Field

## Installation

```jsx
import { SpinField } from 'oe-library';  
```

## When to Use

The Spinfield is a UI Component that can be used to decrease or increase a
numerical value. Values can be changed stepwise or as autorepeat. If the change
takes place stepwise, the value of the Spinfield is written directly. Exception:
The Spinfield is used in a Dialog. Present Value

The Spinfield might display a Present Value. It shows the original value
compared to the value the user changed. This Present Value is always displayed
as soon as the user edits the Spinfield, even if the values are the same.

## Examples

import { default as SpinField } from './SpinField';
import { _SpinField } from './SpinField';

<Playground>
  <SpinField
    enabled
    value={0}
    onChange={(value) => console.log(value)}
    minValue={0}
    maxValue={1000}
  />
</Playground>

## Props

<PropsTable of={_SpinField} />
